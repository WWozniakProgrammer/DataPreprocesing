# DataPreprocessing

## Introduction
- A brief description of what data preprocessing is.
- Explanation of why it is important and why it is done.

## Data Description
- What data and from where?
- Short overview of the structure: number of records, columns, data types.
- Initial visualization and basic statistics.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Checking for missing values.
- Identifying duplicates and outliers.
- Visualizing the distribution of selected variables.

## Data Preprocessing
- Filling in missing values, presenting methods to handle this issue.
- Removing duplicates.
- Encoding categorical variables (One-Hot Encoding, Label Encoding).
- Normalizing or standardizing numerical data.
- Handling outliers (e.g., removal, capping, replacing with median).

## Summary
- Summary of preprocessing effects (how much data was removed, how variable distributions changed).
- Comparison of the dataset before and after preprocessing.
- Brief conclusions about data quality after the applied changes.
- Optionally, run a simple KNN model before and after to compare model accuracy.
